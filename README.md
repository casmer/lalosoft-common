Lalosoft Common Libraries
Years ago I wrote a number of libraries it used on my personal projects with the intent of creating software products for sale. These are C# libraries that just made life a little easier for me.
The most useful parts ones I created to generate CRUD for Sql Database Operations. I also wrote a tool that could generate data object classes and access classes based on a sql database. This included bulk insert methods, and individual record insert, update, and delete operations.
